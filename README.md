# LungDiseaseDetectionUsingAIModels
Millions of people worldwide have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis, which has made it challenging for doctors and radiologists to distinguish it from other lung diseases that have similar symptoms. Chest X-ray diagnosis is a readily available method with low radiation exposure that can identify various lung infections. To aid in the early detection of lung diseases, computer-aided diagnosis systems can be used. Previous studies have used complex deep learning models that require significant time and resources, but this study proposes a more efficient approach. The study used various state-of-the-art CNN architectures, such as VGG, Inception, XceptionNet, AlexNet, Mobile Net, ResNet, DenseNet, and Efficient Net, to classify COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and lung opacity. The COVID-19 Radiography Database, which contains 21,165 annotated images with their corresponding masks, was used in the study. The results showed that the EfficientNetB5 with optimization was the most accurate, with a 99% accuracy rate. The proposed model is deemed suitable for clinical diagnosis and triaging of X-ray images. In addition, the study demonstrated an efficient technique, the Grad-CAM method, for displaying the presence of lung diseases.
